![Panthera-HT Host](images/1.png)

This is the host-side project for the Panthera-HT robotic arm. It includes SDK examples for real robot control, a backend service, and a browser frontend. The project is mainly used to:

- Connect to a Panthera-HT real robot and run position, gravity compensation, impedance, and related control modes.
- Display the robot 3D state, joint state, and end-effector state in real time in the browser.
- Run SDK example scripts from `panthera_python/scripts/` directly from the web page.
- Use Demo simulation mode to develop and test the frontend/backend UI without a real robot.

## Basic UI Overview

### Panels Open By Default

The interface is divided into left and right areas after startup:

- **Left:** `Joints` is the robot joint position and velocity control panel. `Robot Connection`, located to its right, shows the robot connection status and provides basic control mode switching.

- **Right:** `End Effector` is the pose panel. From top to bottom, it displays position, orientation, external force, and torque.

## Quick Launch

### 1. Prepare The Environment

Use Ubuntu 20/22/24, and install Miniconda or Anaconda first.

First make the scripts executable:

```bash
chmod +x install.sh install_oneclick.sh backend.sh frontend.sh
```

Choose the install path based on your setup:

- If you have already configured the Python SDK `panthera` environment by following [panthera_python/README.md](panthera_python/README.md), run:

```bash
./install.sh
```

- If you have not configured the `panthera` environment yet, you can run the one-click installer:

```bash
./install_oneclick.sh
```

If `npm install` reports warnings during this process, you can try:

```bash
npm audit fix --force
```

`./install.sh` only installs digital-twin dependencies and builds the frontend. `./install_oneclick.sh` creates/updates the `panthera` environment and installs the robot SDK plus digital-twin dependencies.

### 2. Check The Real Robot Connection

Before starting live mode, confirm that:

- The robot workspace is clear of people and obstacles.
- Power, serial/CAN devices, and hardware connections are ready.
- The correct robot configuration file is being used.
- `0_robot_get_state.py` can read robot state correctly in the `panthera` environment.

### 3. Start The Backend

Open a new terminal and start the live backend, which uses local port `5000` by default. After startup, the robot joints will be locked:

```bash
./backend.sh
```

This is equivalent to:

```bash
./backend.sh --live --config ../../panthera_python/robot_param/Follower.yaml --port 5000
```

If no real robot is connected and you only want to learn the UI or debug the frontend/backend, start Demo mode instead:

```bash
./backend.sh --demo
```

### 4. Open The Page

Open the backend URL in your browser:

```text
http://localhost:5000
```

The backend serves the built frontend directly. Once the page is loaded, you can view robot state, control joints, and run example scripts from the browser.

Note: Only start the frontend dev server when developing or changing frontend code:

```bash
./frontend.sh
```

The frontend dev server uses `http://localhost:3000` by default and supports hot reload. After changing frontend source code, run `./install.sh` again or run `npm run build` in `Panthera_digital_twin-main/frontend` if you want port `5000` to serve the latest page.

## User Guide

### 1. Open The Page And Check Connection Status

After starting the backend, open:

```text
http://localhost:5000
```

Check the top or side status information first:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/0.png" alt="Panthera-HT Host" width="90%">
</p>

- In the `Robot Connection` panel:
  - `Connect` connects to the robot.
  - `Disconnect` disconnects the current connection.
  - Seven entries under `Joints` represent six robot joints and one gripper.
- At the bottom of the `End Effector` panel, `Connected` indicates that a real robot is connected. `Demo Mode` means the system is in simulation mode and will not control real hardware.
- In the `Robot Connection` panel, make sure the `Server URL` matches the startup configuration. If you did not change the configuration, keep the default setting.

### 2. Observe The Robot In The 3D View

The center of the page shows the robot 3D model:

- The model pose updates in real time according to backend joint state.
- The red dot marks the end-effector position.
- Drag with the left mouse button to rotate the camera, and use the mouse wheel to zoom.

If you update the URDF or model files, restart the backend and refresh the page.

### 3. Use The Joints Panel

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/2.png" alt="Panthera-HT Host" width="90%">
</p>

The `Joints` panel shows and controls the 6 arm joint positions.

If the robot is not at zero position when connected, click `Reset` to return it to zero.

Common operations:

- Drag a joint position slider to adjust a joint target.
- Type into the numeric input for more precise adjustment.
- Use the velocity slider or input box to set the velocity used by position commands. The default value is `0.6`.
- Click `Send Position` to send the current joint target positions to the backend.
- Click `Reset` to return all joints to zero.

Demo mode is safe for learning the interface. In live mode, always confirm the robot workspace is safe before sending commands.

### 4. Use CONTROL MODE

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/3.png" alt="Panthera-HT Host" width="90%">
</p>

`CONTROL MODE` in the `Robot Connection` floating panel switches the backend control mode.

Preset modes:

- `Position`: position control mode. The `Joints` panel and `Send Position` must be used in this mode.
- `Gravity`: gravity compensation mode. The arm becomes backdrivable and can be hand-guided for teaching.
- `Gra+Fri`: gravity + friction compensation mode. It adds friction compensation on top of `Gravity`, changing the hand-guiding feel.
- `Impedance`: impedance control mode. The arm follows a target position with compliance, useful for interaction and force-direction feedback.

Notes:

- When switching from `Gravity`, `Gra+Fri`, or `Impedance` back to `Position`, the backend uses a smooth reset strategy to avoid sudden jumps.
- In `Gravity` and `Gra+Fri`, the gripper is released so it can be moved manually.
- In `Impedance`, the gripper uses a light MIT hold control.

### 5. Use WAYPOINTS For Trajectory Planning

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/4.png" alt="Panthera-HT Host" width="90%">
</p>

The `Waypoints` section records multiple joint poses and executes them in sequence.

Basic workflow:

1. Move the robot to a target pose in the `Joints` panel, or hand-guide it in gravity compensation mode.
2. Click `+ Add Current` to save the current pose as a waypoint.
3. Move the robot to another pose and add more waypoints.
4. Set the duration for each waypoint as needed.
5. Click `Position` to switch back to position-velocity control. After the robot returns to zero, click `Run Trajectory` to move through the waypoints in order.

The backend applies smooth interpolation during trajectory execution. In live mode, verify that every waypoint is in a safe workspace and that the trajectory will not pass through the table, fixtures, or people.

### 6. Run SDK Example Scripts

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/5.png" alt="Panthera-HT Host" width="75%">
</p>

The `Scripts` panel reads:

```text
panthera_python/scripts/
```

Workflow:

1. Select a script in `Select Script`.
2. Click the run button to start it.
3. Watch the page state and backend terminal output.
4. If scripts under `panthera_python/scripts/` were updated, click `Refresh` to reload the list.

In live mode, scripts directly control the robot. Before running a script, open it and confirm what it does.

### 7. Recommended Beginner Workflow

For first-time use, follow this order:

1. Run `./install_oneclick.sh` to install the environment, SDK, and digital-twin dependencies.
2. Run `./backend.sh --demo` to start the Demo backend.
3. Open `http://localhost:5000`.
4. Drag joints in the `Joints` panel and click `Send Position`.
5. Try switching `CONTROL MODE` and understand what each mode does.
6. Add several `WAYPOINTS` and run a simple trajectory in Demo mode.
7. After confirming that the 3D model moves correctly, try running a simple script.
8. After the workflow is familiar, switch to live mode.

## FAQ

### How Do I Develop Without A Real Robot?

Use Demo mode:

```bash
./backend.sh --demo
```

### The Frontend Page Does Not Open

For normal use, confirm that the backend is running, then open:

```text
http://localhost:5000
```

Only start the frontend dev server when developing frontend code:

```bash
./frontend.sh
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000`. If port 3000 is occupied, use `./frontend.sh --port 3001`.

### The Backend Cannot Find The Conda Environment

First follow [panthera_python/README.md](panthera_python/README.md) to manually install the `panthera` conda environment and robot SDK, then run:

```bash
./install.sh
```

To reinstall digital-twin dependencies, run `./install.sh` again. `./install.sh` does not create or remove the `panthera` environment and does not install the robot SDK.

### Need To Skip System Dependency Installation?

If you only want to install digital-twin conda, Python, and npm dependencies without changing system packages:

```bash
INSTALL_SYSTEM_DEPS=0 ./install.sh
```

## More Information

Live mode and scripts under `panthera_python/scripts/` may directly control real hardware. Always check script behavior and site safety before running them.
